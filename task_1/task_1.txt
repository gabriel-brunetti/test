Task no. 1

Create a 300x250 banner. Randomly select four offers from the JSON file. The layout of the banner should be as in the attached example (banner.jpg).
Add a "jumping frame" animation â€“ a frame around the offer that switches to the next offer every two seconds. From the last offer, the frame should switch back to the first one.
When hovering the cursor over the banner, the animation should stop, and if it is hovering over one of the offers, the frame should appear on this offer.
After the cursor leaves the banner, the frame should continue the animation from the last active offer.
Please code the banner in plain JavaScript, without using frameworks like React, Vue. The use of animation libraries is allowed (like GSAP, Anime.js, etc.).

Images, prices and currency should be loaded from the JSON file:https://rekrutacja.webdeveloper.rtbhouse.net/files/banner.json
